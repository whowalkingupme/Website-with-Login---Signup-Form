If you’re new to web development, creating a website with login and registration forms is an excellent way to learn and practice basic skills like designing a navigation menu bar, creating a website homepage, and building login and registration forms.

In this blog post, I’ll guide you through the process of creating a responsive website with login and registration forms using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By completing this project, you’ll gain practical experience and learn essential web development concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, conditional statements, and more.

In this project, the website’s homepage features a navigation bar and a login button. When you click on the button, a login form will popup with a cool blurred background effect. The form has an image on the left and input fields on the right side. If you want to sign up instead, simply click on the sign-up link and you’ll be taken to the registration form.


The website’s navigation bar and forms are completely responsive. This means that the content will adjust to fit any screen size. On a smaller screen, the navigation bar will pop up from the right side when the hamburger button is clicked and in the forms the left image section will remain hidden.

## Steps to Create Website with Login & Registration Form

To create a responsive website with login and registration forms using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, follow these simple step-by-step instructions:

1. First, create a folder with any name you like. Then, make the necessary files inside it.
2. Create a file called index.html to serve as the main file.
3. Create a file called style.css to hold the CSS code.
4. Create a file called script.js to hold the JavaScript code.
5. Finally, download the Images folder and place it in your project directory. This folder contains all the images you’ll need for this project.
